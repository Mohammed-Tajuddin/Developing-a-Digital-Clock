# Multi-Theme-Digital-Clock
In this project, I have designed a digital clock with the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScipt.
For the development, I have used the date functions that are there in the JavaScript.
I have added an option to view the clock in different themes, which was done by combining the concepts of CSS and JavaScript.
